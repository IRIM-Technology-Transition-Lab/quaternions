python_quaternions
==================

A library to handle quaternions. The library is partly tested (see tests). It
would be great to get everything (edge cases and functions) under testing.

There are some great resources out there on quaternions. A few of particular use:

- `Ancient NASA paper <http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770024290.pdf>`_
- `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>`_
- `Geometric Tools Paper (lots on interpolation) <http://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/Quaternions.pdf>`_
- `Euclidean Space Quaternions Page <http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/realNormedAlgebra/quaternions/index.htm>`_
